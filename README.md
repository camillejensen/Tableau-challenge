# Examining User Trends between June 2019 and June 2020

In June of 2019, New York City began softly reopening the city after the Covid-19 hard lockdowns. I wanted to see how user type changed from the same month of the previous year. I hypothysized that membership would be down in 2020 compared to 2019. Based on the trends, this hypothesis was correct. Usage all together was down, but non-member riders increased in 2020 from 2019. I suspect this is due to less commutes to the office, changes in daily routines and resposibilites, etc. There was less of a demand for memberships, and more spontaneuous rides. 

In both years' data, riders born between 1980-1995 were the largest demographic of subscribers. This could be due to a number of concerns including environmental, financial, and overall health. An unexpected trend found theres a spike in non-member riders for people born in 1969, both pre and post lockdown.
